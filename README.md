paper will be soon published

The two folders contain the one-dimensional diagram and the code for the test function experiment, respectively. Physical pic simulations can also be performed when epoch is installed later. At the top level is the 1D schematic drawing code, which is redundant and the same as "the process of one-dimensional plot" folder. I will remove the redundant code later.
